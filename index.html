    <h2><u><strong>About Me</u></strong></h2>

    <p><i>NÃ©e Emily Vulaca </i> to Fijian immigrants in Camperdown, NSW, Australia.
        To be the child of an immigrant, the first generation Australian, meant taking on the responsibility of
        my
        family; carrying the hopes and dreams of my lineage in this 'Promise Land.'
        My childhood gave me a perspective that has been my greatest strength in all areas of my life.
        My parents moved to Australia to build their dream, witnessing their journey was my becoming.</p>

    <p>Moving to the U.S in 2013, I metaphorically found myself standing in my parents worn-out shoes. A new
        land. New faces. No job.
        No family or friends.

        Nothing but a little suitcase filled with hopes and dreams in this vast Land of Opportunity.
        Albeit, I was in much fortunate standing than my parents were, with a Bachelors degree in hand and the
        ability to speak English.
    </p>

    <p>As a child, I viewed my parents as always patient and carefree, but reflecting now, I see two people who
        were
        vulnerable; struggling to make ends meet in their new world.
        Moving to a new country forced me to build up the same <strong>resilience</strong> they developed in
        being able to start over.
        And the resilience I gained since I moved here carried me through reinventing my career and
        boldly stepping out and making necessary transitions, all with Tutu's (my grandfather) words resounding
        in my ear,
        "There is no such word as 'failure' to those who say, "I will.""</p>

    <p>Over my years of residing in the U.S, I have gained a greater appreciation for the life my parents built
        in
        Australia as immigrants. I love the life that I have built for myself here and the friends who have
        become my family.
        I will always marvel at our innate ability as humans to create something from nothing. </p>
